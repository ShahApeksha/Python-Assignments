IMAGE MANIPULATION AND IMAGE DATA PROCESSING

1. Image Loading and Display: Your program should allow users to load an image file 
and display it. Ensure you use an image processing library like Pillow (PIL) to handle 
image data.

2. Image Manipulation: Implement at least two image manipulation operations, such 
as:

• Applying filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection).
• Changing image dimensions or cropping.
• Adjusting brightness, contrast, or saturation.
• Converting to grayscale or other color spaces.

3. Histogram Analysis: Implement a feature that calculates and displays histograms for 
different color channels of the loaded image. Allow users to analyze and manipulate 
histogram data.
